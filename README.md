# VDC CCmd Dump

This plugin dumps all ConCommands and ConVars, regardless of flags, in a wikitext table format for use on the Valve Developer Community.

*NOTE: Most client CCmds aren't accessible in the server dll, so they won't be dumped if you run this on a dedicated server.
Instructions on how to run this (as well as MM + SM) on client can be found [here](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Talk:List_of_TF2_console_commands_and_variables).*
